# demo_app_planets
This is my first attempt at playing around with Algolia's platform. This is a demo app which loads some basic information about the planets in the solar system through `add_index_planets.py` to my Algolia account, then uses node and _InstantSearch.js_ to create a frontend app to search through the data.
