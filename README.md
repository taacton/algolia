# Algolia

## Description:
This project contains my attempts to play around with uploading indices to Algolia's platform and creating a simple frontend app using [InstantSearch.js](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/).

`demo_app_planets` contains my first app, which was built pre-interview to better understand product while `demo_app_wines` is my submission for the technical assessment. Please refer to the `README.md` inside each app's folder for more information.
